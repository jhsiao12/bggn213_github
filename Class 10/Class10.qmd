Reading CSV File
```{r}
#Loading in data
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
head(stats)

#Removing commas and changing character vectors into numeric vectors
rm.com <- function(x) {
  as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))
}

pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.com)
pdbstats #there's no row names!

#adding row names back in
rownames(pdbstats) <- rownames(stats)
pdbstats

```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
rounded <- round(totals/totals["Total"] * 100, 2)

rounded["X.ray"] + rounded["EM"]

```
93.16%

## Using Mol* to examine HIV-Pr

Here is a rubbish pic of HIV-Pr that is not very useful yet.

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Because the resolution of the structure is larger than the size of hydrogen atoms.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

408


> Q6: Below...

## Using the bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb

```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom) #full atom list

head(pdb$atom$resid) #residue names (not all are amino acids)

pdb$calpha #which atoms in the file are residues?

aa321( pdb$atom$resid[ pdb$calpha ] ) #using aa321() to get 1 letter AA code of amino acids in the pdb file

```
## Predicting functional motions of a single strucutre

Run a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) - a bioinformatics method to predict functional motions.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)


```

Make a trajectory in time to visualize...
```{r}
mktrj(modes, pdb = adk, file = "modes.pdb")

```
